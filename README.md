# Python Server-Client Communication

This Python script allows you to run a simple server-client communication over a local network using sockets. The script can act as both a server and a client, and the role is determined by command-line arguments.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. Run the script as a server:

    ```bash
    python script.py server
    ```

4. Run the script as a client:

    ```bash
    python script.py client
    ```

## Features

- **Server Mode:** Run the script as a server to listen for incoming client connections.
- **Client Mode:** Run the script as a client to connect to a server.

## Requirements
